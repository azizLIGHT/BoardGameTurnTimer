# Board Game Turn Timer

A simple web application for timing turns during board games. Our group found ourselves wanting to speed up our gameplay while playing Oath (incredible game, but so much analysis paralysis), so we started timing our turns. After this became a regular thing, I searched around for a timer app that fit our needs, but surprisingly couldn't find anything. All the timer apps I found either required a download, were ugly, complicated, noisy, or were made for Chess. So, I decided to make my own.

This app doesn't require a download or login, and is usable right from the browser. Just plug in your players' names and start. It will track turns and provide stats like average turn length, shortest turn, and longest turn per player. It works equally well for fixed-turn-order games as for those with a flexible turn order. This is a purely a "count up" timer, and does not have turn time limits or alarms. The goal was to be simple and unobtrusive. This is meant to be run from a single device, likely one player's phone or tablet, although it looks good on a wide variety of screen sizes.

## More Screenshots

You should really just go browse around the app, but if you want to see more of it first, here's some screenshots:
